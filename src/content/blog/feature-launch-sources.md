## Intro 

Wonder how your WiselyDesk virtual assistant knows more about your product than you?

We've explained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiselydesk.com/blog/how-does-wiselydesk-generate-the-answers">how WiselyDesk generates the AI answers</a> - but where does it get the information about your specific proudct? 

With the sources feature, users are provided a link to the sources that informed the AI response about your product.

## Sources

Each time a user asks a question, WiselyDesk identifies the most relevant knowledge base articles with similar meanings by comparing their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiselydesk.com/blog/how-does-wiselydesk-generate-the-answers">word embeddings</a> for semantic similarity. We then pass the content of those knowledge base articles to build the context for the AI to generate a response. 

If you or your users want to view the most likely sources of the AI response - then click the *Source* link. 

<div class="text-center">
<sup >1. When using the bot, you can click on the Source link at the bottom of an AI message</sup>
</div>
<img src="/sources-ai-feature-wiselydesk.png" alt="Sources Feature" class="mb-1 rounded mt-0">

<div class="text-center mt-16">
<sup >2. A new tab opens with the source, in this case a Zendesk article.</sup>
</div>

### Note - "most likely sources"

Before the AI answers a question, WiselyDesk provides relevant knowledge base articles as context. However, the generation of AI responses mostly remains a black box to the tech industry - as there isn't full visibility into the AI's reasoning. This makes it not possible to absolutely guarantee the AI's use of provided context.

While we haven't found our virtual assistant ignoring sources, regular monitoring is needed. We apply various engineering safety techniques and battle-tested bot instructions to address this. We'll discuss this more in future blog posts and conversations.

### Outro 

We hope to help increase the general knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of this new AI technology for the customer service industry. If you have any questions or topics you would like us to cover in the next blog post, please let us know!
